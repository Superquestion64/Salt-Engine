# In this game the hero must evolve fast enough to defeat the villain
If the hero fails to defeat the villain in time, it's game over. The villain is too powerful to defeat
Here is a list indicating what makes this game unique:
- An intro and ending sequence!
	The intro sequence will guide new players on how to play the game, it comes in two parts
	Part one of the intro shows how the hero can evolve by eating enough salt
	Part two of the intro shows the hero can defeat the villain when strong enough
	There are also two different endings in the game
	In one ending the hero is victorious, and expresses joy by jumping up and down
	The other ending is the villain's victory, they will mockingly jump in the screen
- Background, Hero, Villain, DemoUnit, SaltSpawner classes
	The above are custom made classes implemented for the game
	They each are optimized to fulfill their own purposes, allowing for cleaner, efficient code
	Unit class has been transformed into purely virtual to indicate objects that can be consumed by the hero
- Logic determining the villain's defeat
	In game logic dictates there are two ways for the villain to be defeated
	Either the hero must consume enough salt such that they are larger, thus more powerful than the villain
	Or the hero has reached their final form, therefore they can overpower the villain regardless of size
- Logic determining the villain's victory
	The villain's goal in this game is to reach their final form
	When the villain reaches their final form they cannot be defeated by the hero, it is automatic game over
- Evolution mechanic
	Both the villain and the hero can evolve throughout the game
	The villain will grow stronger over time represented by their growing size
	The hero must eat salt to evolve into their final form, it is their objective to overpower the villain
- Salt spawning and villain teleportation
	Salt spawns in random places of the map, it is up to the hero to consume as much salt as they can
	The villain will teleport randomly across the map in an attempt to avoid the hero
	Salt spawns every second of the game, and the villain will teleport and evolve every 4 seconds
- Custom Assets
	27 assets have been custom made for this game
	The hero has many forms to indicate their stage in evolution, they are all represented with a different asset
	Likewise the villain takes on different forms for each evolution, this requires a new asset each time
	Salt spawns across the map, this is represented with one asset
	There are custom backgrounds in this game, for the intro sequence, main arena, and ending sequence
- Debug mode
	With debug mode enabled the player can spawn as much salt as they want into the map by pressing space
	Debug mode is enabled when Game_Debug is defined in the MyGame project
	By default debug mode is defined through CMake
	Spawning salt is considered cheating as the game is intended to be won without this mechanic
- Window closing functionality
	Implemented functionality for the game window to close
	Pressing Esc or clicking the x button of the window will close the game and end the program
